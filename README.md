# How-to-Build-a-Number-Guessing-Game-in-Python
#In this project, you will create a simple number guessing game that allows the user to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The program will give hints to the user after each guess, indicating whether their guess was too high or too low, until the user guesses the correct number.
